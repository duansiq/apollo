[313.377s] You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
[313.377s] changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
[313.377s] state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
[313.377s] 
[313.377s] If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
[313.377s] do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
[313.377s] 
[313.377s]   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
[313.378s] 
[313.378s] Or undo this operation with:
[313.378s] 
[313.378s]   git switch -
[313.378s] 
[313.378s] Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false
